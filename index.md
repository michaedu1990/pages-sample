At it's heart, CollectionBuilder is a set of Jekyll projects or templates designed following the Lib-Static development methodology which aims to lower the barriers for development and deployment of digital collections, while upholding the unique values and perspectives of GLAM institutions.

CollectionBuilder prioritizes pragmatic, sustainable, and simplified approaches to infrastructure to ensure the tool is 'do-able' and approachable for digital knowledge workers in libraries and museums, empowering them to take control of their web systems. An experiment in 'minimal computing', CollectionBuilder provides a depth of learning opportunities and development possibilities, allowing users to take complete ownership over the project and make their work open to the world.
